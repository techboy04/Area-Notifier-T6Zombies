# Area Notifier
Its been awhile since I made a script but I had an idea while playing some Tranzit and its what if there was a giant message that tells you what area you entered in. (Similar to the message pop ups that show in Apex Legends)

Credit to 5and5 for the zone name code snippet from their Bo2-Remix script. 

## Installation
Download areanotifier.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using areanotifier_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice
